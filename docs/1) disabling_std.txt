By default, all Rust crates link the standard library, which depends on the operating system for features such as threads, files, or networking. It also depends on the C standard library libc, which closely interacts with OS services. Since our plan is to write an operating system, we canâ€™t use any OS-dependent libraries. So we have to disable the automatic inclusion of the standard library through the no_std attribute.

we can do that by writing this on the top "#![no_std]"
